/**
 * The logic for Complex.compartment check is implemented as following:
 * 0). The complex should have no-empty compartment value.
 * 1). There should be only one compartment value in Complex though the value itself is a multi-valued
 * attribute
 * 2). The value of an Complex should be one of its subunits' compartment values, which may have more than
 * one.
 * 3). There should not be more than two compartment values in all subunits. If two compartments in
 * subunits, these two compartments should be adjacent.
 * 4). includedLocation is not checked.
